In this guided project, you'll be using Visual Studio Code to develop an application that uses a dictionary to autocomplete words and provide spelling suggestions. You'll use an existing project that contains some starter code and operations for a trie data structure. You'll use the GitHub Copilot extension to help you interpret, develop, and test the code.

## Project overview

Suppose you're working on a language processing feature for a new application. Your feature needs to support a large number of words, and quickly search for words that match a given prefix to provide autocompletion. You'll also need to implement spelling suggestions for misspelled words. You've been given an existing code base that uses a trie data structure, which is a tree-based data structure that's particularly useful for prefix matching and autocompletion. You'll need to understand the code base and extend it to support your features.

## Setup

Use the following steps to prepare for the Guided project exercises.

1. Open Visual Studio Code and under the **Start** menu, click **Clone Github Repository**.

1. In the "Clone from Github" field, enter the following URL and click **Clone from URL**:

    https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/Guided-project-Build-an-Autosuggest-Engine-with-Copilot.git

1. In the popup window, create a new folder to select as the Repository Destination.

1. Wait for the project to download, then open the project.

    You may need to acknowledge that you trust the authors of the project to enable the project to run.

1. Visual Studio Code may notify you that the workspace has multiple Visual Studio Solution files. 

    Click **Choose** and select **TrieDictionary.sln**.

1. Expand the **TrieDictionary** folder and open up **Program.cs**.

Now you're ready to begin the Guided Project exercises. Good luck!
